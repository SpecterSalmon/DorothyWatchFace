Dorothy Versa 2 Watch Face

This is a watch face based off the character Dorothy from the game "VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action" for the Fitbit Versa 2.

This watch face is made only for the Versa 2, but you can edit it to work or other smartwatches if you so fit. Please keep these points in mind:

-Don't charge people for it.
-If you make any changes to improve or work for other smartwatches, please add a branch to add to it so people can hopefully see a version that works for the watch they have.

Other than that, go nuts.

The font is the System font for Fitbit, while all graphics is from the game made by Sukeban Games, and are all owned by them.
